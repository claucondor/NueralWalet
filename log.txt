The high debt/payment ratio (9.82) is a major red flag, indicating potential reliance on external funding or risky behavior. While transaction frequency is acceptable, the overwhelmingly outgoing nature (5 out of 6 transactions are sent) and reliance on a single large incoming transaction create significant concern. The limited history prevents a higher score, even with the frequency. Baseline score is 250 + 60 for frequency.",

        "Increase incoming transactions and demonstrate consistent receipt of funds.",
        "Reduce the debt/payment ratio by prioritizing incoming value over outgoing.",

        "Diversify transaction partners; avoid concentrating transactions with a single address."

    "englishRecommendation": "Subject: Your DeFi Credit Profile – Actionable Insights\n\nYour current credit score of 110/1000 indicates a **high-risk** profile within our platform. This score suggests limited credit history and potential instability. A key risk factor is your high debt/payment ratio of 9.82 – meaning your outflows significantly exceed inflows. Additionally, the concentration of transactions (5 out of 6 being outgoing) and reliance on a single incoming transaction are concerning.\n\nTo improve your score, we recommend:\n\n1. **Prioritize Receiving XLM:** Focus on increasing incoming transactions to balance your net flow.\n2. **Reduce Outgoing Volume:** Carefully evaluate outgoing transactions and minimize unnecessary spending.\n3. **Expand Network:** Transact with more unique addresses to demonstrate broader DeFi participation.\n4. **Consistent Activity:** Continue daily transactions, aiming for at least 20 total transactions to establish a stronger history.\n\n\n\n"
